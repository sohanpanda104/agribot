## 🧭 Step-by-Step: RPLiDAR A1M8 with Raspberry Pi 4 (USB)

---

### 🟢 **STEP 1: Plug in the RPLiDAR**

* Connect the **RPLiDAR A1M8** to your Raspberry Pi 4 using the **USB cable** that comes with it.

  * You’ll see the motor spin slowly when it powers up.

---

### 🔍 **STEP 2: Check if RPi Detects It**

Open the Terminal and type:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

✅ If it's connected, you will see something like:

```
/dev/ttyUSB0
```

❌ If you see nothing, try:

```bash
dmesg | grep tty
```

Look for a line like:

```
... now attached to ttyUSB0
```

---

### ⚙️ **STEP 3: Give Yourself USB Access (only once)**

Run:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

Then **reboot**:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### 📦 **STEP 4: Install Required Packages**

After reboot, open Terminal again:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip git cmake g++ libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

---

### 📁 **STEP 5: Download the RPLiDAR SDK**

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk.git
```

---

### 🛠️ **STEP 6: Build the Demo Program**

```bash
cd ~/rplidar_sdk/sdk
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If successful, the demo will be created in:

```
~/rplidar_sdk/output/Linux/Release
```

---

### 🧪 **STEP 7: Run the LIDAR Demo**

Now run this command:

```bash
cd ~/rplidar_sdk/output/Linux/Release
./rplidar_sdk_demo /dev/ttyUSB0
```

✅ If working, you’ll see:

```
RPLIDAR S/N: ...
Firmware Ver: ...
Detected 360 points...
```

❌ If error, check:

* Is it `/dev/ttyUSB0`? (If not, replace with correct one)
* Is LIDAR spinning?
* Did you reboot after `usermod`?

---

### 🐍 **OPTIONAL: Use in Python**

1. Install the Python package:

```bash
pip3 install rplidar
```

2. Run this Python code:

```python
from rplidar import RPLidar

lidar = RPLidar(None, '/dev/ttyUSB0')

info = lidar.get_info()
print(info)

for scan in lidar.iter_scans():
    print(scan)
    break

lidar.stop()
lidar.disconnect()
```

You should see output like:

```
('RPLIDAR A1', 'firmware version', etc.)
[(quality, angle, distance), ...]
```

---

### ✅ Done!

You’ve now connected and read data from the **RPLiDAR A1M8** on your **Raspberry Pi 4** via **USB**.
